# Video Player for Waterlilies

To use this video player, load the nine Waterlilies videos by David Humphrey into the `jit.playlist`, and ensure that `waterlillies.maxpat` \[sic\] has the correct host and port information for the computer running the video. 

The host should be the public IP address for the video computer and the port is hardcoded to `7893`.
