## Installation notes for the Performer

Before you download and run the Water Lilies performance patch, you will need the following:

- Max 8.5.4 (or the latest download of Max, available here: Download Max | Cycling '74 (cycling74.com))
- The "ease" package, available on the Max Package Manager (navigate to File > Show Package Manager). 
- The "PeRColate" package, also available on the Max Package Manager

Once you have clicked on "Install" for the "ease" and "Percolate" packages, you can restart Max. Then, you should be able to open and run the Water Lilies patch(es).

You should not need to have Max authorized with a license in order to run these patches.
